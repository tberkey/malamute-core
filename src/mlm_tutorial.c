    tutorial.c - Malamute tutorial

    Learn how to use the Malamute C APIs in a single breath. Malamute lives
    as a C library, exposing a simple class model. In this tutorial we'll
    take you through those classes, and show with live data how they work.

//  This header file gives us the Malamute APIs plus Zyre, CZMQ, and libzmq:
#include "../include/malamute.h"

int main (int argc, char *argv [])
{
    //  Let's start a new Malamute broker
    zactor_t *broker = zactor_new (mlm_server, NULL);

    //  Switch on verbose tracing... this gets a little overwhelming so you
    //  can comment or delete this when you're bored with it:
    zsock_send (broker, "s", "VERBOSE");

    //  We control the broker by sending it commands. It's a CZMQ actor, and
    //  we can talk to it using the zsock API (or zstr, or zframe, or zmsg).
    //  To get things started, let's tell the broker to bind to an endpoint:
//     zsock_send (broker, "ss", "BIND", "tcp://*:12345");

    //  This is how we configure a server from an external config file, which
    //  is in http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:4/ZPL format:
    zstr_sendx (broker, "LOAD", "src/malamute.cfg", NULL);

    //  We can also, or alternatively, set server properties by sending it
    //  SET commands like this (see malamute.cfg for details):
    zsock_send (broker, "sss", "SET", "server/timeout", "5000");

    //  For PLAIN authentication, we start a zauth instance. This handles
    //  all client connection requests by checking against a password file
    zactor_t *auth = zactor_new (zauth, NULL);
    assert (auth);

    //  We can switch on verbose tracing to debug authentication errors
    zstr_sendx (auth, "VERBOSE", NULL);
    zsock_wait (auth);

    //  Now specify the password file; each line says 'username=password'
    zstr_sendx (auth, "PLAIN", "src/passwords.cfg", NULL);
    zsock_wait (auth);

    //  The broker is now running. Let's start two clients, one to publish
    //  messages and one to receive them. We're going to test the stream
    //  pattern with some natty wildcard patterns.
    mlm_client_t *reader = mlm_client_new ();
    assert (reader);
    int rc = mlm_client_set_plain_auth (reader, "reader", "secret");
    assert (rc == 0);
    rc = mlm_client_connect (reader, "tcp://127.0.0.1:9999", 1000, "reader");
    assert (rc == 0);

    mlm_client_t *writer = mlm_client_new ();
    assert (writer);
    rc = mlm_client_set_plain_auth (writer, "writer", "secret");
    assert (rc == 0);
    rc = mlm_client_connect (writer, "tcp://127.0.0.1:9999", 1000, "writer");
    assert (rc == 0);

    //  The writer publishes to the "weather" stream
    mlm_client_set_producer (writer, "weather");

    //  The reader consumes temperature messages off the "weather" stream
    mlm_client_set_consumer (reader, "weather", "temp.*");

    //  The writer sends a series of messages with various subjects. The
    //  sendx method sends string data to the stream (we send the subject,
    //  then one or more strings):
    mlm_client_sendx (writer, "temp.moscow", "1", NULL);
    mlm_client_sendx (writer, "rain.moscow", "2", NULL);
    mlm_client_sendx (writer, "temp.madrid", "3", NULL);
    mlm_client_sendx (writer, "rain.madrid", "4", NULL);
    mlm_client_sendx (writer, "temp.london", "5", NULL);
    mlm_client_sendx (writer, "rain.london", "6", NULL);

    //  The simplest way to receive a message is via the recvx method,
    //  which stores multipart string data:
    char *subject, *content;
    mlm_client_recvx (reader, &subject, &content, NULL);
    assert (streq (subject, "temp.moscow"));
    assert (streq (content, "1"));
    zstr_free (&subject);
    zstr_free (&content);

    //  The last-received message has other properties:
    assert (streq (mlm_client_subject (reader), "temp.moscow"));
    assert (streq (mlm_client_command (reader), "STREAM DELIVER"));
    assert (streq (mlm_client_sender (reader), "writer"));
    assert (streq (mlm_client_address (reader), "weather"));

    //  Let's get the other two messages:
    mlm_client_recvx (reader, &subject, &content, NULL);
    assert (streq (subject, "temp.madrid"));
    assert (streq (content, "3"));
    zstr_free (&subject);
    zstr_free (&content);

    mlm_client_recvx (reader, &subject, &content, NULL);
    assert (streq (subject, "temp.london"));
    assert (streq (content, "5"));
    zstr_free (&subject);
    zstr_free (&content);

    //  Great, it all works. Now to shutdown, we use the destroy method,
    //  which does a proper deconnect handshake internally:
    mlm_client_destroy (&reader);
    mlm_client_destroy (&writer);

    //  Finally, shut down the broker by destroying the actor; this does
    //  a proper shutdown so that all memory is freed as you'd expect.
    zactor_destroy (&broker);
    zactor_destroy (&auth);
